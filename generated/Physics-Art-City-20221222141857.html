  <p>
   The concept of "intersectionality" is a term used to describe the interconnected nature of social categorizations such as race, class, gender, and other forms of identity. It was first coined by Kimberlé Crenshaw in 1989 to explain how different forms of oppression can overlap and create unique experiences for individuals. Intersectionality recognizes that individuals can experience multiple forms of discrimination and oppression simultaneously, and that these experiences are not mutually exclusive. For example, a black woman may experience both racism and sexism, and her experience of these two forms of oppression will be different than that of a white woman or a black man. Intersectionality also acknowledges that individuals can have multiple identities, and that these identities can interact in complex ways. For example, a person may identify as both disabled and queer, and their experience of discrimination and oppression will be different than that of someone who only identifies as one or the other.
