Welcome to AuthorAI documentation!
===================================

*Human and AI in partnership for low-code/no-code authoring automation*

At AuthorAI we want to reimagine the authoring experience powered by AI. We want to explore how state of the art in AI can evolve the *authoring flow* as it applies to creating apps, books, blogs, sites, data, designs, reports, etc. We are happy to launch AuthorAI Blogger as first in series of such APIs.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
